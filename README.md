# Morphologic-AI

Spatial information embedded in images of cells or tissues provide important cues as to the health and functionality of different cells in response to challenges. In particular, Infectious diseases continue to pose significant challenges to global health, and understanding their effects at the cellular level is critical for the development of new therapeutics. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) changes in morphology in  response to infectious agents is an important readout that could provide insight into the mechanisms of action of infection. We will utilize the changes observed in cellular morphology measured with fluorescent markers - Hoechst DNA, ConA, Phalloidin, Syto14, and WGA - along with computer vision-based approaches to segmentation to measure changes in cellular morphology - to identify drug-infectious disease interactions in RxRx19a and b datasets. Drugs that move morphological HUVEC readouts towards a “normal” phenotype could be candidates for drug repurposing.  We aim to develop an automated, scalable solution for analyzing high-throughput microscopic images of HUVEC cells infected by pathogens,and impacted by whole genome crispr screens. Candidate drugs could be used in a functional screen to test response to the disease.
